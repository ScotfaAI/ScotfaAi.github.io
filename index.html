                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD student in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Sciences at the University of Warwick, focusing on the innovative integration of artificial intelligence with microscopy. My work aims to automate complex imaging processes, enhancing research capabilities and accuracy in biological studies.</p>
                <p>I work with a variety of flourescence microscopy methods, particularly the Spinning Disk Confocal and Lattice LightSheet.</p>

                <h2>Open To Work</h2>
                <p>I am interested in a variety of roles, particularly those in the automation/analysis Biological and Medical images both in academia and in industry. I would prefer to also have some integration with hardware. My dream job is one that is new and interesting, where I can be learning something new almost every day.</p>
                <p>I am currently moslty working in python at the moment, but am learning C++ in my spare time. During my MEng in Computer Science and PhD I have used a variety of other languages and frameworks.</p>
